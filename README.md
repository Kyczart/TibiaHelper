# TibiaHelper
In tibia, the BattleEye security feature was implemented so that automatic healing programs could no longer be used. When you tried to use one of the popular programs, the application detected cheating and you were banned. I wrote such application which verifies life/mana level and automatically presses key when it drops below certain level. I added also cyclic pressing key every specified time. Below I attach a link to video showing how the application works:
